<h1 align="center">Online Shop Testing</h1>

Description:
    
>This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in testing 
an online shop. It includes various files that are essential for managing 
and documenting the testing process. The primary focus is on understanding 
and practicing software testing, including test case creation, bug 
reporting, and regression testing.

Included Files:

* requirements.yml

        This document outlines the requirements and specifications for 
        the online shop application. It serves as a reference for what 
        the system should do and helps in creating test cases

* test-cases.yml

        This spreadsheet contains a list of test cases that need to be 
        executed to verify the functionality of the online shop. Each 
        test case provides step-by-step instructions on how to test a 
        specific feature or functionality

* testing-report.yml

        This document is used to record the results of the test cases 
        executed. It includes pass/fail status, comments, and any 
        deviations from the expected behavior

* bugreports.yml

        This spreadsheet is used to document any issues or defects
        discovered during testing. Each bug report should include 
        details such as the issue description, steps to reproduce, 
        severity, and priority

* regress-report.yml

        This document is used to track the results of regression 
        testing. It helps ensure that new code changes or bug fixes 
        do not introduce new defects or break existing functionality

Conclusion:

>This project provides valuable experience in testing an online shop application and serves as a practical training ground for software testers. By following the instructions in this readme and utilizing the included files, you can effectively learn and practice software testing techniques.
